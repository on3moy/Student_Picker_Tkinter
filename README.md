## About

Simple Python application built with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for the GUI, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for handling CSV files, and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image processing. The app randomly selects a student from your provided list, ensuring that everyone gets a chance until all names have been pickedâ€”at which point, it resets and starts over!

## Usage

Prepare your CSV file.  

1. Create a CSV file containing your student names. For best results, the CSV should have no header and list the student names in the first column. For example:  

    ```csv
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
    David
    ```
2. Run the app.

    ```bash
    python student_picker.py
    ```

### The backend code that picks up the list

```python
# You can see this only pulls the first column, you can adjust to your liking!
df = pd.read_csv(file_name, header=None, usecols=[0])
student_names = df.iloc[:, 0].to_list()
```
